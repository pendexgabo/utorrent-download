# uTorrent Download


The extension adds an item in the contextual menu when right click is done over a magnet link. You can then, send that link to the uTorrent UI without leaving the current page.

Just install the extension, update your uTorrent server settings and start using it.
No ads, not spyware. This just works...I added it because I got tired of extensions full of this kind of stuff.
Do you have feedback? Please post it here: http://bit.ly/1rP8bxS (google store feedback)

If you think the extension is cool and you are in a good mood you can consider buying me a beer :) Just press the button in the settings page

## About


I wanted to give Chrome extensions a try, so I came out with this idea.

The extension adds a contextual item in the menu for links that start with ```magnet:?``` or that ends with ```.torrent``` so you can send such link to the uTorrent Web UI
